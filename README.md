# National-Code-Validate-and-Save
This code first gets an Iranian national code.
Then checks if its valid or not with the formulas of a valid national code.
After that, if it was a new national code, it gets a first name and a last name and saves it to a file.
If it wasn't a new national code, it shows the info about the person.
